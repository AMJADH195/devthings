## How to Install LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySql & PHP) on AWS EC2 with Ubuntu 18.04
In this article step-by-step process is discussed to setup LAMP stack in AWS EC2. This will include :
- Creating an EC2 instance
- Connection to the instance from your system
- Install Ubuntu 18.04
- Install Apache 2.4
- Install PHP 7.2
- Install MySql 5.7
- Install phpMyAdmin 4

### Step 1 - Launch an AWS EC2 Virtual Machine
Log into the AWS EC2 Management Console, and click on the button Launch Instance
### Step 2 - Choosing the OS and Hardware
Clicking on the option from Step 1 takes to the below page. Here you get to choose the OS for the virtual machine and also the other hardware. Select Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type.

In the next screen choose the instance type. In this tutorial, t2.micro instance is selected as it is free-tier eligible. Single processor core and 1 GB memory is good enough for general purposes.

### Step 3 - Editing Some Basic Configurations
Go for the default settings for Configure Instance, Add Storage and Add Tags screens.

However add 2 rules under Configure Security Group. They are SSH and HTTP.

SSH is required to login to the virtual machine using command line. This is already added to the security group.

HTTP is for the web server that will be installed shortly. To add HTTP rule, click on Add Rule & choose HTTP from the dropdown.

As per AWS documentation, security groups acts as a virtual firewall. In short you can set up the rules regarding IP addresses that can access the added protocols. For the tutorial, both the protocols are open to all IP addresses. But you can also restrict some IP addresses from accessing all protocols. This can be edited later also.

Clicking Review and Launch button in this page takes us to a page where you can review our instance settings. Click on the Launch button.

### Step 4 - Creating a Key Pair
The next page will present with options for Key file. This key file is used to connect to the EC2 instance from your system.

Choose the option Create a new key pair and download the key file.

With the key file downloaded, the button for launching the instance became active. And clicking that button is the last step to launch the instance in AWS.

With the successful launch of the instance, you will be redirected to the page which gives a success message that instance has been launched.

### Step 5 - Locking the Key File
The permission for the downloaded key file needs to be changed so that it is not publicly viewable for SSH to work. It is achieved by :

```sh
sudo chmod 400 path/to/key/file
```

### Step 6 - Connecting to Instance
The key file that was downloaded will now be used to connect to the EC2 instance from our system via SSH. In this tutorial a Linux system is used, so we are using the Linux terminal for SSH access.
1. SSH to the instance using the key file and hostname. The hostname here is generated by combining the EC2 username (which is ubuntu for Ubuntu 18.04) with the public DNS Name with a @ character.

    Example: ubuntu@ec2-54-91-219-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com

    The following command is used for SSH :

    ```sh
    sudo ssh -i "path/to/key/file" ec2-hostname
    ```
    Replace ec2-hostname with the hostname of the instance.

2. Type yes if it gives a connection warning.
3. Upon a successful connection you will enter in to the remote ec2 machine
    Now you can start installing the necessary software on this EC2 instance.

### Step 7 - Installing Apache
1. Before installing Apache, you need to update the package list for upgrades and new packages.
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
2. Now Apache can be installed.
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install apache2
    ```
3. Following the installation of Apache, if you navigate to the public IP of the instance (that can be found from the EC2 Console) from a browser, you will see the familiar Apache Welcome Page. This implies Apache is running perfectly.
